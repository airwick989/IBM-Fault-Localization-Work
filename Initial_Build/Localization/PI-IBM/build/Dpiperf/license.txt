By downloading any of the WBI performance tools, the IBM Owner grants and you (requester) agrees to accept
the following terms and conditions for a non-transferable right to use the performance tools,
herein called 'tools'.

The tools are for IBM use and shall not be used or made available outside of IBM.

The tools are provided on an 'AS IS' basis without any expressed or implied warranties of merchantability
or fitness for a particular purpose.

The tools may provide the capability to do instruction level tracing and/or profiling. The requester must
ensure that any USE WITH NON-IBM SOFTWARE IS COMPLIANT WITH CORPORATE INSTRUCTION NUMBER 130, which provides
guidelines for activities related to examination of non-IBM software. The burden of ensuring that the
requester has reviewed the use of the tools with his LEGAL and IPL Attorneys is the responsibility of
the requester. 

The tools may not be fully tested. The requester agrees to notify the owner of any problems discovered 
in the tools and assist the owner in problem isolation/correction/verification. The owner will make reasonable
efforts to correct problems but does not represent or warrant that problems will be corrected. 

Since the tools may not be fully tested, the output or data produced by the tool may not be correct.  The output
should not be distributed outside of IBM.

The requester may NOT reproduce and redistribute, shall not merge the tools into another program, shall not
alter, change or modify the tools, shall not reverse assemble or reverse compile the tools and may not lend,
transfer, or assign the tools to anyone else. 

This Agreement is effective from the date on which it is accepted and shall remain in force until termination. 
The Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party. If terminated, the requester agrees to destroy
all copies and remove all installations. 

The requester acknowledges that this Agreement has been read and is understood, and agrees to be bound by its
terms and conditions. This statement of agreement supersedes all previous agreements.
