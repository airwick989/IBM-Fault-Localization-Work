// In general, for primary replica, the load method should only be called once when
// initialization, so we do not need synchronized here. And for secondary replicas, though the
// load method could be called multiple times, we will never call other methods so no
// synchronized is also fine.
// But we have a refreshStoreFiles method in the Region interface, which can be called by CPs,
// and we have a RefreshHFilesEndpoint example to expose the refreshStoreFiles method as RPC, so
// for safety, let's still keep the synchronized here.
